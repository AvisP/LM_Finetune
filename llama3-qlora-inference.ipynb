According to Alan Watts, a renowned philosopher and writer, the concept of the self is a myth, a mere illusion.

He saw the self as a kind of \"social fiction,\" a narrative we tell ourselves to make sense of our experiences and to distinguish ourselves from others.\n\nIn his book \"The Book on the Taboo Against Knowing Who You Are,\" Watts wrote, \"The self is not something ready-made, it is something that is constantly being created and recreated in the process of living.\"\n\nWatts's perspective is rooted in Eastern philosophy, particularly Buddhism and Taoism. He believed that the self is an illusion, a mere appearance, and that true reality lies beyond the boundaries of the ego. He argued that our sense of self is a kind of \"identification\" with our thoughts, emotions, and physical bodies, which creates a sense of separation and duality.\n\nWatts's ideas challenge the conventional notion of a fixed, essential self.
